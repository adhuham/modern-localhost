# üè† Modern Localhost
Modern Localhost is a beautified version of your typical localhost index page.

## Install
Download this repo and extract `index.php` to your `www` folder, or whatever is your server's root. You can also replace your webserver's default index page to it.

## Support
This project is targeted for so-called LAMP environments (Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP). Also equally supports MAMP and WAMP. Other environments can also be supported but with a little bit of tweak.
